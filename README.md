This can be used in the specific case for when:
  - You put your Quizlet term and defition on opposite sides
  - You have a tab (\t) seperating your term from definition
  - You have a newline seperating each of your cards

You can insert the correctly formatted text by going to Quizlet, clicking the three dots inside of the flashcard set, and the clicking export (with a tab between the term and defition, and a newline bewteen each card)
